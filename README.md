# Workout-app-client

The front end fora work out app being developed for a Software Engineering class

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, Nodejs must be installed. The easiest way to install Node is through an official binary off of the nodejs website.

[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you are using MacOS, homebrew, a package manager for OSX is an easy way to install Nodel

```sh
brew install node
```

### Installing

The first step to run this frontend is to make sure you are in the root directory, and that you can see a package.json file.

If you have nodejs installed you will run:

```sh
npm install
```

Which will download all of packages and dependencies

The next step is to make sure that the backend is running. The frontend will still work but none the functionality will be available.

After the packages and dependencies have been downloaded, you should now have a node_modules folder.

The last step is to run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the react development server and should open a new tab in a web browser that displays the site.
